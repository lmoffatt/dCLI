# dCLI
Command Line Interface Utitlity

It is intended to provide a simple interfase for the execution of custom C++ functions. 

The grammar is quite simple, it only allow definitions and command executions (functions that return void).

We do not provide the means for custom function definitions build in in the CLI grammar, although definition
of lambda functions would be a natural extension. 





It comes with the following build in types: 
bool, int, td::size_t, double, std::string

It also include the following container types:
std::tuple, std::vector, std::set and std::map
